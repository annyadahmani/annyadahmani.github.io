		       I am a third year PhD student in the Department of Psychology at UC Berkeley, advised by <a href="http://www.gopniklab.berkeley.edu/">Alison Gopnik</a>. I am in the Cognition and Developmental areas with a <a href="https://cogsci.berkeley.edu/cogsci.berkeley.edu/graduatedesignatedemphasis"> Designated Emphasis in Cognitive Science.</a> I am also affiliated with <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley AI Research</a>.
		      I am supported by the <a href="https://ndseg.sysplus.com/NDSEG/About/">DoD NDSEG Fellowship</a> and a Chancellor‚Äôs Fellowship from UC Berkeley.</p>
              <p>
               I received my BS in Cognitive Science 
         with a Specialization in Computing from UCLA in June 2022 where I graduated with Departmental Honors and Cum Laude. At UCLA,
         I mainly worked with <a href="https://www.psych.ucla.edu/faculty-page/taogao/"> Tao Gao</a> in the <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~taogao/"> Visual Intelligence Lab</a>. I was funded by the Dean's Award for Life Science Research during my time at UCLA. I also had the opportunity to be a summer intern at Yale University working with Julian Jara-Ettinger in the <a href="https://compdevlab.yale.edu/research.html">Computational Social Cognition Lab</a>.

My research is at the intersection of cognitive science and artificial intelligence. I am especially interested in how we can build artificial intelligence that draws directly from human cognition, particularly in the areas of learning, exploration, and reasoning. 
I take inspiration from decades of research showing how humans, specifically children, are able to learn so much about the physical and social world so rapidly and flexibly. Yet, there are certain things that young children can do that are still very far from anything that current state-of-the-art AI can do. 
During my PhD, I aim to leverage experimental and computational approaches to better understand the connection between learning, decision making, and reasoning. Recently, I have been focusing on projects centered on automated curriculum learning in humans and machines. I am also exploring how environmental cues (for example, time horizon, safety, controllability, predictability) influence an agent‚Äôs exploration, learning, and goal generation within its environment. Additionally, I have been very much interested in the intersection of cognitive science and LLMs/VLMs and am hoping to expand more into this area currently.
